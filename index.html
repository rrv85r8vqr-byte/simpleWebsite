<h2>Integrity</h2>
<p>
Integrity is one of my core values. I believe in being honest, ethical, and accountable 
in both my personal and professional life. Doing the right thing, even when it is difficult 
or unnoticed, is how trust and credibility are built. I hold myself to that standard at all times.

<h2>Transparency</h2>
<p>
Transparency is extremely important to me because it is essential for building trust. 
As a leader of soldiers, I have a responsibility to keep them informed and provide clear 
guidance. I carry this same approach into every relationship, hoping to create an environment 
where openness is mutual.

<h2>Continuous Learning</h2>
<p>
I value continuous learning because there is always more to learn, especially in a constantly 
changing world. To be the best version of myself and to remain reliable for others, I have 
to stay open to new ideas and adapt to new situations. This is a lifelong commitment that 
I work to uphold every day.

<section>
<h2>Respect</h2>
<p>
Treating others with respect is the main value that guides how I interact with 
people. I was raised with the idea that good manners can take you places money cannot. 
While it may seem simple, that mindset has a strong impact on relationships. I make a 
conscious effort to lead with respect in everything I do.
